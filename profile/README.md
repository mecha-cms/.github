About
-----

Mecha is a minimalist web content management system built to evolve. We have a core system that is no more than 500 KB
in size, and we’ll keep it under that size forever. If you’ve been around for a while, you’ll probably have a hard time
finding meaningful feature additions to Mecha from time to time, as the main focus of Mecha is to keep things simple. It
just provides a way for other features to come in without having to change the system.

Mission
-------

The world has been filled with social media services that are no longer safe to share personal matters. I want to grow
back the interest of future generations to write journals on the internet. This content management system ensures that
you have complete control over your content.
