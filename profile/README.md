Mecha CMS
=========

> Mecha is a flat-file content management system that carries the concept of minimalism.

The world has been filled with social media services that are no longer safe to share personal matters. I want to grow back the interest of future generations to write journals on the internet.

This content management system ensures that you have full control over the content you have. There is no logo, URL and access right from our parties.

I am currently working mainly on the [core](https://github.com/mecha-cms/mecha) system and [panel](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.panel) extension. All of these tasks usually trigger stress and boredom. This sponsorship is important to me to keep developing this software for people.
